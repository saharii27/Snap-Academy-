      <p>
        I'm Sahar, a Computer Science student deeply passionate about tech equity and digital education.
        I created this platform to empower girls and underserved learners, especially those from
        communities like Afghanistan, who don’t always have the opportunity to access quality tech resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who once faced barriers to education, I believe that knowledge should be accessible
        to everyone, no matter where they come from. This catalog was built with heart, purpose, and the hope
        that it can spark change, one line of code at a time.
